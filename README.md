I'm thrilled to present my recent project, developed as part of my collaboration with Prodigy Infotech. The task was to create a seamless and responsive navigation page using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This project has been an incredible learning experience.

### Technologies Used:
- *HTML*: For the structural layout of the page.
- *CSS*: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- *JavaScript*: For adding interactive elements and enhancing user experience.

A big thank you to the team at Prodigy Infotech for their guidance and support throughout this project.
